AUTOJOB DEVELOPMENT GUIDE

PROJECT OVERVIEW
AutoJob - Automated job application platform using AI
Tech Stack: Next.js 16, TypeScript, MongoDB, NextAuth.js, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Langchain

CORE PRINCIPLES

1. No Hardcoded Data
   - Never use fake/mock data in production
   - Always fetch from database or external APIs
   - Use environment variables for configuration

2. No Overcomplicated Fallbacks
   - Simple try-catch with clear error messages
   - Return consistent format: { success: boolean, data?, error? }

3. ALWAYS Present Implementation Options First
   - NEVER implement features without presenting 2-3 approaches first
   - List pros/cons for each approach
   - Wait for user to choose the preferred method
   - Only then implement the chosen approach

4. Remove Deprecated Code Immediately
   - Clean up unused imports and files
   - Keep codebase minimal and functional

PROJECT STRUCTURE

app/
  (auth)/              - Auth routes (sign-in, sign-up)
  (root)/              - Main app routes
    jobs/              - Jobs listing
    resume/            - Resume upload
    artifacts/         - Generated artifacts
  api/                 - API routes
    jobs/              - Job endpoints
    auth/              - NextAuth handler
    resume/            - Resume endpoints
    artifacts/         - Artifact generation
models/                - Mongoose models
lib/                   - Utilities
  actions/             - Server actions
  agents/              - AI agents
  ai/                  - AI integrations
components/            - React components
database/              - DB connection

AUTHENTICATION
- NextAuth.js v5 with JWT sessions
- Supports Credentials + Google OAuth
- Protected routes: check session?.user?.id
- Don't modify auth.ts format - NextAuth is strict

DATABASE MODELS

User: name, email, password, provider, role, studentProfile, resumeArtifacts, applyPolicy
Job: externalJobId, source, company, title, location, description, requirements, skills
Application: userId, jobId, resumeVariantUsed, status, attempts, timeline

All models use Mongoose with TypeScript interfaces. Always use models?.ModelName || pattern.

API PATTERNS

Standard API Route:
  - Check auth if needed (await auth())
  - Connect to database
  - Query data
  - Return { success, data } or { success: false, error }
  - Always use try-catch

Standard Page Component:
  - Use "use client" for hooks/event handlers
  - Server components for async data fetching
  - Consistent dark theme: bg-gray-950, gradient accents

DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

When user requests a feature:
  1. Understand requirements
  2. Present 2-3 implementation options with pros/cons
  3. Wait for user choice
  4. Implement with clear comments explaining WHY
  5. Keep it simple - add complexity only when needed

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
MONGODB_URI, NEXTAUTH_SECRET, NEXTAUTH_URL, GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET, OPENAI_API_KEY

CURRENT STATE
- Authentication working (Credentials + Google)
- Job listing and auto-apply endpoints
- Resume upload with PDF parsing (using OpenAI gpt-3.5-turbo)
- Basic artifact generation

Remember: Present options before coding. Keep responses simple. Remove unnecessary code.
